# LyonRewards-API

## Presentation

LyonRewards is a social citizen platform for the city of Lyon, in France, based on a system of rewards. It provides a complete end-to-end system to reward citizens based on their means of transport and events occuring in the city. 

This project is aimed at showcasing a few selected usecases, but has been built to be modular and favors an easy integration with external systems. 

It was conducted as part of the final project of our 4th year Computer Science Masters at INSA Lyon. 

## Architecture

The project is divided between a REST API, a website, and an Android app. This repository contains the code for the REST API.
